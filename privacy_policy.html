    <p>This web site (“Site”) is owned and operated by VolunteerSpot, Inc., dba, SignUp.com (referred to as “SignUp.com” herein). Signup.com has created this Privacy Policy in order to help you understand what data we collect, why we collect it, and what we do with it. This Privacy Policy applies to the information we collect when you use our “Services”, which means any website, mobile website, application or service we offer, or when you communicate with us. For information about choices we offer under this Policy, please see “Your Choices” below. We encourage you to read this Policy carefully when using our Services or transacting business with us. Any questions regarding this Policy should be directed by email to privacy@SignUp.com.

        Information we receive about you
        We collect information about you when you create an account, use our Services and communicate with us. We also collect information, such as usage statistics, by using cookies, server logs and similar technologies. Some of it is personally identifying, some is not.

        Information you provide. We may collect and store any personal information from you that you enter on our Services or that is provided to us in some other manner. This includes identifying information such as your first and last name, title, email address, telephone number, address, and if you transact business with us, financial information such as your payment method (valid credit card number, type, expiration date or other financial information). We may also request non-personal information such as the activity types you organize, your location, school address, organization types you support, service hours, or we may ask you complete a survey or send us a review.
        Information you provide about others. We collect and store personal information about other people that you provide to us through your use of our Services as a SignUp Organizer (or as a Participant signing up others) in inviting them to your SignUps or in creating Contact Lists or sending messages. We use Participant’s contact information which may include first and last name, email address and phone number to invite them to your SignUps, allow them to sign up and comment on your activities, and send follow-up communication such as confirmation and reminder messages. At your direction, the SignUp may display the names and initials of Participants who have signed up. All of your Participants may request that you delete their name from a Participant or Contact List by messaging you through the Service or by emailing support@signup.com and requesting to be removed from our database.
        Information others share about you. We receive certain personal information about you from other users when Organizers enter your contact information or invite you to a SignUp. In addition, a SignUp Organizer may have Assistant Organizers who are able to see the SignUp’s Participant information which may contain your name, email address, phone number and answers to questions asked by the Organizer. You may request that an Organizer delete your name from a Participant or Contact List by messaging the SignUp Organizer through the Service or by emailing support@signup.com and requesting to be removed from our database.
        Information from social network services (including Facebook). If you register or log into your account through a third-party social media service such as Facebook or Google, we will have access to some of your third-party account information from that service in authenticating your identity including your name, email address, and other information in that account, as authorized by that service. You have the ability to disable the connection between our Service and your third-party account at any time or adjust the privacy settings on those services.
        Information we collect automatically from your use of the Service. When you use our service, we automatically receive information from the browser, computer and/or device from which you visit our Services. This information may include:
        Login information: We collect information about your use of the platform (without limitation), your IP address, your browser type and language, access times, the content of any undeleted “Cookies” that your browser previously accepted from us, pages viewed, and the page you visited before visiting our Service.
        Device information: We collect information about the computer or device you use to visit our Service including hardware model, operating system and version, unique device identifiers and mobile network information.

        Information from cookies and similar technologies: We and our service providers collect information using various technologies including cookies and pixel tags which help facilitate your access to our Services and to personalize your online experience. Through the use of a cookie or similar technology, we also automatically collect information about your online activity on our Services, such as the web pages you visit and the links you click. We may also include tracking pixels in promotional or other email messages and newsletters to determine whether messages have been opened and if links in the messages have been clicked. The information we obtain from cookies and other technologies enables us to customize our Services, to deliver targeted advertisements, and to measure the overall effectiveness of our Services, content and advertising. We and third-party vendors, including Google, use first-party cookies (such as the Google Analytics cookie) and third-party cookies (such as a DoubleClick cookie) together to report how your ad impressions, other uses of ad services, and interactions with these ad impressions and ad services are related to visits to our Services. Additionally, SignUp.com or a data provider we have engaged may place or recognize a unique cookie on your browser or email to enable you to receive customized ads or content on unaffiliated websites, apps, or online services for advertising, analytics, attribution, and reporting purposes. These cookies may include IP address, browser or operating system type and version, or inferred-interest information. The cookies may reflect demographic or other data linked to data you voluntarily have submitted to SignUp.com, e.g., your email address, that we may share with a data provider solely in hashed, non-human readable form that can NOT be decoded to personally identify you.
        Information collected by third parties. We may allow our authorized service providers, advertising companies, and ad networks, to display advertisements on our Services and/or use tracking technologies to collect information about users who view or interact with their advertisements or use the Service. Our Services do not provide or grant access to any personally identifying information to these third party advertisers. The tracking technologies allow the third parties to deliver targeted advertisements and gauge their effectiveness. Some of these third-party advertising companies may be interest-based advertising companies that may use cookies to collect non-personally identifiable information during your visit to the Service in order to help show advertisements on other websites likely to be more interesting to you.
